Projects 
Here are some of the projects that I have worked on or contributed to:

Beep 🔋
Beep is a simple Python GUI application that helps a user limit the number of charge-cycles they use, thereby increasing the lifespan of the laptop battery. The theory behind this is that a laptop battery has a number of predefined charge-cycles, and every time we charge a battery to 100%, we lose one cycle. For this reason, manufacturers recommend that you shouldn't charge your battery to 100% all the time. The charge percentage is, however, hard to keep track of; therefore, Beep notifies you when your battery reaches a certain threshold (80%).

Work Experience 💼
I have worked for several companies over the last couple of years, starting in 2021 where I took an intern role at Pelican International, a procurement company based in Kampala. I then worked on a number of projects with Inter Miles, Code Sync and also did several projects under the mentorship of Chris Kateera built on Frappe Framework: Open Source Low Code Framework. More recently, I worked at AfroFleet Technologies (South Africa) and Bitcoin Innovation Hub (Uganda) before resuming my studies here at UTM.
