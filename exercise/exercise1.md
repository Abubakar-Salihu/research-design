## 5 Exercises for Exploring Your Research Topic (Chapter 1: Introduction)

These exercises will help you delve into your chosen research topic within computer science or data science and lay the foundation for a strong introduction chapter.

**1. Brainstorming and Problem Identification:**

* **Objective:** Identify a specific problem or challenge within your chosen field.
* **Instructions:** 
    * Start by researching a broad area within computer science or data science (e.g., machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing). delve into recent research papers, industry reports, and expert blogs.
    * Don't just skim the surface; actively seek out current advancements, identify trends, and pinpoint areas where limitations exist or questions remain unanswered.
    * Consider real-world applications of these areas and brainstorm any limitations or issues that arise. Look for bottlenecks, inconsistencies, or potential biases that create problems.
    * Once you have a comprehensive understanding of the chosen domain, brainstorm a list of potential problems. Prioritize those that pique your interest and hold significant real-world implications.
    * Don't be afraid to refine your problem scope further. As you delve deeper, aspects that initially seemed like separate issues might converge into a larger, more impactful research question.

**2. Motivation and Significance:**

* **Objective:** Explain the importance of addressing your identified problem.
* **Instructions:**
    * Research the impact of the chosen problem on the broader field. 
    * Consider potential consequences if left unaddressed. 
    * Use real-world examples to showcase the problem's significance. 
    * Explain how successfully addressing this problem can benefit the field and related industries. 

**3. Research Question Formulation:**

* **Objective:** Formulate a well-defined research question that guides your investigation.
* **Instructions:**
    * Based on your chosen problem, develop a specific question that you aim to answer through your research. 
    * Ensure the question is focused enough to be achievable but also offers valuable insights. 
    * Consider using question framing techniques like "How can...?" or "To what extent does...?"
    * Refine your question to ensure it sparks curiosity and guides your research steps. 

**4. Research Objectives Breakdown:**

* **Objective:** Outline actionable steps (objectives) to answer your research question.
* **Instructions:**
    * Break down your overarching research question into smaller, achievable objectives. 
    * Each objective should be clear, measurable, and contribute directly to answering your main question. 
    * Consider aspects like data collection, methodology development, evaluation criteria, or specific outcomes to be achieved.
    * Ensure all objectives are achievable within your research timeframe. 

**5. Literature Review and Significance of Contribution:**

* **Objective:** Understand existing research, identify gaps, and highlight the potential contribution of your study.
* **Instructions:**
    * Conduct a comprehensive literature review in your chosen area. 
    * Identify relevant studies that address similar problems or use related methodologies. 
    * Analyze existing literature to identify any limitations, unanswered questions, or areas for improvement. 
    * Explain how your research aims to address these gaps and contribute valuable knowledge to the field.

By completing these exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of your research topic, develop a clear research question and objectives, and articulate the significance of your work within the broader field.
